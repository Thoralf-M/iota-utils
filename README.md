# IOTA utils

`pnpm i && pnpm run dev`

As long as the https://github.com/iotaledger/iota repo is still private, fork it next to this folder and link the packages manually (might need to run `pnpm i` in the iota root first)
`pnpm link ../iota/sdk/typescript`
`pnpm link ../iota/sdk/wallet-standard`
`pnpm link ../iota/sdk/bcs`
